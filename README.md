###General Informaion###

This repository contains the codes for the following work:

- Yinjie Huang, Michael Georgiopoulos and Georgios C. Anagnostopoulos, 'Accelerated Learning of Generalized Sammon Mapping', IJCNN 2011.

There are three algorithms implemented for Kernel Sammon Mapping (KSM): 

- Iterative Majorization (IM)
- Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)
- Parallel Tangents (PARTAN)

###Requirements###

To run this software, you need to have the following components installed:

- Mathworks MATLAB


###Installation###

This software does not require any installation. Just drop the files into a folder.


###Usage###

- Please put the data sets in the current folder. An example 'SwissRData75' is contained. 
- All the results are saved in one file. Users can extract number of steps, time consumed for each algorithm from this file.

###Citation###

If possible, please cite the following paper:

- Yinjie Huang, Michael Georgiopoulos and Georgios C. Anagnostopoulos, 'Accelerated Learning of Generalized Sammon Mapping', International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011.
